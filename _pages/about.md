# 🧑‍🎓 About Me
This is **Ying Li**. I am currently a Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore (NUS), working under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandre Thiéry](https://alexxthiery.github.io/) and [Prof. Jeremy Heng](https://sites.google.com/view/jeremyheng/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computing and Data Science at The University of Hong Kong in 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Zhang](https://michaelzhang01.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my M.Phil. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in 2022 and my B.Eng. degree from Shandong University in 2019. My research interests include Bayesian nonparametrics, Bayesian deep learning, and their applications to neuroscience.
